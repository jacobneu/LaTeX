HOW TO CHANGE TEXMFDIST (for future reference):

    pdflatex looks for .sty files in a particular subdirectry of wherever the TEXMFDIST is set to. To figure out where this is, run the following command:

        kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFDIST

    let's say the result is /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist (this is the result when I'm running it on CMU's afs server, where I'm working from at the moment -- 2017-06-09). If this is the TEXMFDIST, then pdflatex will look for .sty files in the following directory,

        /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex

    regardless of the directory structure within this latex folder if there's a .sty file in there, pdflatex will find it. If you can, move your user-defined .sty files into this folder. If you put foo.sty in the top level of this latex folder, then if you run

        kpsewhich foo.sty

    from anywhere, then you should get something like

        /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/foo.sty

    You can use /usepackage{foo} iff kpsewhich foo.sty returns a filepath.

    Now, if you do not have access to the location of TEXMFDIST (for example, I do not have access to /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex on CMU's afs server), then you're not out of luck. Here's how to make pdflatex look for files elsewhere:

    1. Pick a directory where you want to toss the .sty files. This should (obviously) be a location where you have read/write access. For the purposes of this example, I will be placing a git repo called LaTeX inside of the directory ~/private/localtexmf.

    2. Within that directory, create subdirectories:

            /tex/latex

    you must use these names EXACTLY. So, to recap, I have the directory structure

        ~/private/localtexmf/tex/latex

    3. Put all your .sty files you want inside this directory. You can structure the directories witin the latex directory however you want. In this example, I am cloning the LaTeX git repo (which already exists) inside the latex folder.

    4. Now, do the above kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFDIST to get your current TEXMFDIST. I will use as my example /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex, as stated above. Then run the following command EXACTLY (except, replacing my example filepaths with the relevant filepaths):

        export TEXMFDIST=/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex:~/private/localtexmf

    i.e. you need to run export TEXMFDIST=[--your current TEXMFDIST]:[--your desired TEXMFDIST--]. I believe you can string more than 2, but I haven't tried. If you're doing what I'm doing (SSH-ing into CMU's afs server), then you might need to do this every time you log in. It seems like my bash settings get wiped every time, unless I put them into bashrc. I'm not 100% sure though.

    5. (Optional) If your bash settings are not persistent, then you can do what I did (this advice may only apply to CMU's afs server. Idk how it's different on a local machine or another server config). Go into your bashrc file

        vim ~/.bashrc

    and add a line

        export TEXMFDIST="/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex:~/private/localtexmf"

    (note the quotation marks). This seems to so far) update my bashrc settings every time I SSH in, so my TEXMFDIST is set. I haven't actually tested this extensively, so take with a grain of salt. If it doesn't work, try

        source ~/.bashrc

    which should run the bashrc file and apply the desired command (among others in your bashrc file). Idk how bash works, so this might be incorrect.

Then you should have it! Try the kpsewhich foo.sty command mentioned above and see if your .sty files behave how you want them to now!
